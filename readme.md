# Probability Visualizer

"A data visualization web app that helps you see and understand your odds!"

*Data visualization* is important for organizations of all stripes these days. This simple app can serve as a useful educational tool to demonstrate the value of (and fun in) visualizing data.

By generating red and black dots that correspond to specific inputs, this app clearly illustrates probabilities and odds &mdash; turning abstract numbers into concrete visual representations.

## Using this app: Two Main Features

1. ***Your Stat*** (the default):
    - Lets users enter an "*x*-in-*y*" fraction.
    - The app will generate coloured dots to help the users visualize their inputted fraction.
    - The app will also calculate and display the probabilities and odds.
    - For percentages, enter the desired value for *x* and "100" for *y*.

2. ***Random Stat***:
    - Generates and displays visualizations for the odds and probabilities of interesting random statistics and facts already stored in the web app.

## Accessibility Notes

I've added a "colour switch" that lets users turn colour "on" and "off" to help folks living with colour-vision deficiency (especially red-green colour blindness) more easily use this web app.

For the visualization, instead of generating red and black dots, which aren't easy for red-green CVD users to distinguish, the accessibility version instead generates filled and unfilled (black and white) dots to represent probabilities and odds.

## Inspirations

This visualizer is inspired by books like [*Making Numbers Count*](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Making-Numbers-Count/Chip-Heath/9781982165444) and [*The Data Detective*](https://timharford.com/books/datadetective/).
