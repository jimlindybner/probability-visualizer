# Probability Visualizer

A web app that helps you visualize and understand your odds!

## 2 features:

- “Random Stat” visualizes the odds and probabilities of random statistics and facts stored on the website.

- “Your Stat” (default) lets you enter a fraction to help you visualize the probabilities and odds of “x in y.”

## Additional Information

“Data visualization” is very important for companies these days and this app can help educate people on the value of (and fun in) visualizing data.

This visualizer is inspired by books like [*Making Numbers Count*](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Making-Numbers-Count/Chip-Heath/9781982165444) and [*The Data Detective*](https://timharford.com/books/datadetective/). 

I've also added a “colour switch” that lets users turn colour "on" and "off" to help folks dealing with colour-blindness more easily use this web app.
