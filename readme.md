# Probability Visualizer

A web app that helps you visualize and understand your odds!

2 features:

- “Random Stat” visualizes the odds and probabilities of random statistics already stored in the website

- “Your Stat (Default)” lets you enter a fraction to help you visualize the probabilities and odds of “x in y”

“Data visualization” is very important for companies these days. This web app is inspired by that (and books like *Making Numbers Count* and *The Data Detective*), but it specifically focuses on probability.

I've also added a “colour switch” that lets users turn colour "on" and "off" to help folks dealing with colour-blindness more easily use this web app.
