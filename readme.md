# Probability Visualizer

A data visualization web app that helps you see and understand your odds!

“Data visualization” is important for organizations of all stripes these days. This simple app can serve as a useful educational tool to demonstrate the value of (and fun in) visualizing data.

Using red and black dots, this app clearly illustrates probabilities and odds &mdash; turning abstract numbers into concrete visual representations.

## 2 Main Features:

- ***Your Stat*** (the default): Lets you enter a fraction to help you visualize the "*x* in *y*" probabilities and odds.
    - Note: For percentages, enter your desired value for *x* and "100" for *y*.

- ***Random Stat***: Generates visualizations for the odds and probabilities of random statistics and facts stored in the web app.

## Additional Notes

I've also added a "colour switch" that lets users turn colour "on" and "off" to help folks dealing with colour-blindness more easily use this web app.

Instead of red and black dots for the visualization, the accessibility version instead generates filled and unfilled (black and white) dots to represent probabilities and odds.

This visualizer is inspired by books like [*Making Numbers Count*](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Making-Numbers-Count/Chip-Heath/9781982165444) and [*The Data Detective*](https://timharford.com/books/datadetective/).
