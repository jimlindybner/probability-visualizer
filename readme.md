# Probability Visualizer

> A data visualization web app that helps you see and understand your odds!

*Data visualization* is increasingly important to organizations of all stripes. This simple app can serve as a useful educational tool to demonstrate the value of (and fun in) visualizing data.

By generating red and black dots that correspond to specific inputs, the *Probability Visualizer* clearly illustrates probabilities and odds &mdash; turning abstract numbers into clear, easy-to-grasp visual representations.

## Using this app: Two Main Features

1. ***Your Stat*** (the default):
    * Lets users enter an "*x*-in-*y*" fraction.
    * The app will generate coloured dots to help the users visualize their inputted fraction.
    * The app will also calculate and display the probabilities and odds.
    * For percentages, enter the desired value for *x* and "100" for *y*.

2. ***Random Stat***:
    * Generates and displays visualizations for the odds and probabilities of interesting random statistics and facts already stored in the web app.

## Accessibility Notes

I've added a "colour switch" that lets users turn colour "on" and "off" to help folks living with colour-vision deficiency (especially red-green colour blindness) more easily use this web app.

For the visualization, instead of generating red and black dots, which aren't easy for red-green CVD users to distinguish, the accessibility version instead generates filled and unfilled (black and white) dots to represent probabilities and odds.

## Inspirations

This visualizer is inspired by books like [*Making Numbers Count*](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Making-Numbers-Count/Chip-Heath/9781982165444) and [*The Data Detective*](https://timharford.com/books/datadetective/).
